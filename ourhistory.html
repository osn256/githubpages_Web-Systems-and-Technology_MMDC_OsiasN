    <div class="panel">
    <p>Since its inception on the 8th of December 1977, the Philippine Association of Landscape Architects (PALA) remains as the national organization representing the profession of Landscape Architecture in the country. A member association of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA), PALA is responsible for the advancement of the profession as an instrument of service in improving the quality of life within a better natural and built environment. 

        PALA also assists in raising the standard of education through accreditation of Landscape Architecture Programs in Philippine colleges and universities. As of now, only three schools were accredited: Bulacan State University, University of San Carlos, and University of the Philippines. All of which offer bachelor courses, with U.P. Diliman offering its sole masteral course.

        To be able to use the title “Landscape Architect” and practice Landscape Architecture in the Philippines, one must be licensed by the Professional Regulation Commission. The Board of Landscape Architecture conducts a thorough examination for licensure and handles professional discipline procedures.</p>
